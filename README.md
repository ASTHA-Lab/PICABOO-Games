# PICABOO: Gamified Learning of Computer Hardware Fundamentals

**Peek Inside your Computer hArdware BOx and explOre (PICABOO)** is a gamified curriculum designed to teach fundamental computer hardware concepts through hands-on, collaborative games using FPGA-based platforms. This curriculum is developed through an NSF-funded collaboration between the University of Kansas and the University of Florida.

## About the Project

Modern computing relies heavily on underlying hardware, but educational focus has increasingly shifted toward software disciplines. PICABOO aims to address this imbalance by introducing foundational hardware principles through engaging games that provide experiential learning using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

The games are designed for both undergraduate and high school students and have been tested through elective courses and the UF Student Science Training Program (SSTP).

## About FPGA and Vivado

**Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** are reprogrammable silicon chips that allow users to implement custom hardware logic without manufacturing new ICs. They are central to PICABOO games, providing a hands-on platform to design, simulate, and implement logic circuits.

**Vivado Design Suite** by Xilinx is used to synthesize, implement, and generate the bitstream for these FPGA designs. Students load the bitstream onto boards such as the Digilent Basys3 or Artix-7 to interact with the games.

## PICABOO Games Overview

Each game in the PICABOO suite targets a specific hardware concept and involves both competition and collaboration.

### üïπÔ∏è Game 1: Convert and Conquer
- **Concepts**: Binary & Decimal number systems, conversion techniques
- **Activity**: Students convert decimal numbers to binary using switches, and results are verified using a seven-segment display.
- **Learning Outcome**: Reinforces understanding of binary encoding and hardware inputs.

---

### üß† Game 2: The Gate Escape
- **Concepts**: Boolean Logic, Combinational Circuits
- **Activity**: Responder teams reverse-engineer circuits using input-output patterns from LED indicators.
- **Learning Outcome**: Enhances circuit analysis and truth-table construction skills.

---

### üîÅ Game 3: Con-Sequence
- **Concepts**: Sequential Circuits, FSM Design
- **Activity**: Challenger team maps FSM with a hidden state; responders try to reach that state by guessing inputs.
- **Learning Outcome**: Builds intuition for state transitions and programmable logic mapping on FPGA.

---

### üíæ Game 4: Store and Score
- **Concepts**: Memory Read/Write, Volatile vs Non-Volatile Storage
- **Activity**: Teams design FSMs to write data to memory and decode it from SSDs, exploring data persistence.
- **Learning Outcome**: Demonstrates memory architecture and control sequencing.

---

### üßÆ Game 5: Control and Compute
- **Concepts**: ALU, Low-Level Instruction Execution
- **Activity**: Teams collaboratively design and build a simple processor capable of executing basic instructions.
- **Learning Outcome**: Integrates ALU, control logic, and memory for full-system perspective.
